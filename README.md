# Stitch
### ---------------Stitch---------------

'Stitch' is a tool for stitching together tiff images within a directory, utilising 
the ImageJ Grid/Collection plugin, and performing this stitching for multiple directories
(each containing a tiff series) in a batch process. The original purpose was to batch stitch 
the output of microscopy using an aurox clarity microscope; with a typical output being many 
directories containing .tiff files to be stitched, a positions.csv file (with tile positions) 
and a companion.ome metadata file. However, this programme can also be used for batch 
processing ONLY using a companion.ome metadata file associated with a tiff series.

### Installation
Stitch is used in Python 3=> environment. 

### Usage
Stitch is used by executing 'stitch_RUN.py', which by default opens up a graphical
user interface. Refer to Stitch_UserManual.pdf for full usage instructions.
